For convinience, i included the entire core maude 3.1 in this project so that one can simply run this project without any configuration or downloading.

### To run this Project

- execute "./maude.darwin64"
- load project/process.maude
- load project/queue.maude
- load project/reader-writer-1.maude
- load project/reader-writer-1-checker.maude

It's the same for reader-writer-2.maude
